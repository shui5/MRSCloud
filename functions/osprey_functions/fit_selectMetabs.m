% USAGE:
% basisSetOut = fit_selectMetabs(basisSetIn, metabList, fitMM)
% 
% DESCRIPTION:
% This function loads the basis set functions for the metabolites
% that have a positive flag set in the structure metabList, which has
% previously been created with fit_createMetabList.
%
% Only basis functions for the metabolites selected in fit_createMetabList
% will be included. This function will output a modified FID-A basis
% set container, which will be subsequently passed on to the fitting
% algorithm.
%
% The function will also include MM and lipid spectra, if present in
% the basis set, and if they were selected to be included.
%
% The other basis functions will be discarded.
% 
% OUTPUTS:
% basisSetOut = FID-A basis set container that only contains the basis
%               functions specified in metabList
%
% INPUTS:
% basisSetIn  = FID-A basis set container (created with fit_makeBasis).
% metabList   = Structure (created with fit_createMetabList) containing
%               flags for each metabolite/MM/lipid basis function that is 
%               supposed to be included in the basis set.
% fitMM       = Flag determining whether MM/lipid basis functions are being
%               kept in the output basis set. 1 = Yes (default), 0 = No.
